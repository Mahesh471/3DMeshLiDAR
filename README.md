iOS: 15.4 and above

# Getting started
1. Make sure you have the Xcode version 14.3 or above installed on your computer.
2. Download/Clone the 3DMeshLiDAR project from the repository
https://github.com/Mahesh471/3DMeshLiDAR.git
3. Open the project files in Xcode.
4. Run the active scheme.

# Future Enhancement
In this POC, We can scan objects placed in front of the device including background scenes and can export to a 3D mesh file (.obj) for further processing.

In iOS 17.0+ Apple provided an enhanced API for Object Capture, in which we can turn the object into ready-to-use 3D models.

Note: Currently iOS 17.0+ is in Beta, will be available publically by September 21, 2023.
